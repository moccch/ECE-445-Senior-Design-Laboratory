## Group 12

### High-Level Requirements

- Maximum penetration depth of 50 cm.
-  The probe can move horizontally, with a minimum displacement of at least 30cm
  along both the x and y axes.
-  The software can record information for all detection points, including depth and
  the magnitude of pressure applied.
-  Users can control the entire system via Bluetooth.
-  The error of the horizontal motor should be controlled within 5%, while the error of
  the vertical motor should be controlled within 2%.
- The relative error of force sensor should be controlled within 5%.
- The precision of the force sensor is 1N, and probe will return if the force exceeds 90N.
-  The software will be able to provide a 3D visualization of the data results, allowing
  users to have a more intuitive understanding of the detected terrain.
